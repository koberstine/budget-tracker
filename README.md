# Budget Tracker

## Description

IndexedDB, Service Worker and manifest.json for an existing budget tracking application. These modifications change the working budget tracker into a mobile-first application capable of working offline and uploading transactions to the server whin internet connectivity is reestablished. Persistent data is stored in the browser, allowing for balance and transaction information to be available while travelling.
